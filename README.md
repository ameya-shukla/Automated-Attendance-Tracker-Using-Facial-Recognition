# Automated-Attendance-Tracker-Using-Facial-Recognition
The program is an automated attendance tracker that tracks the attendance of a person by recognising the face. The tracked attendance is stored in a CSV file format with the file name of the file titled according to the current date.

**Software Requirements**: 

**Hardware Requirements**: Raspberry Pi Model 3B, Raspberry pi camera module Rev 1.3 

 

**Project Overview**:
This project addresses the structure, implementation and application of automated attendance tracker with the help of face recognition and identification which can be used in schools, colleges, offices and many other places where security and automation is required. Automated attendance system using face recognition is a system in which tracking of daily attendance is in an automatic manner and done by the program itself which is done by the recognition and identification of the face with the help of a camera module which is connected with the system. The camera module helps the system with the initial part of the program which is initialization of the camera on which the system can perform its operation. When the face comes in front of the camera, the program compares the face in the camera with the images in the database and recognizes it. These image data are basically known data for the system and is the data on which the system is trained. The system, if recognizes the face after the comparison with the database, displays the name of the person’s face or else displays “UNKNOWN” if the faces don’t match. Then it tracks the attendance of the person file of only the matched faces. This attendance is stored in an excel file format.
